	<h1>ABOUT THE SAMOYED</h1>
	<p>Samoyeds are from the spitz group. They grow to be about 19 to 23 inches tall and were bred to work as herding dogs. Their name comes from the Samoyedic peoples of Siberia. Samoyeds have a double layer coat. The topcoat contains straight hairs, rather than fur which is why they are known to be hypoallergenic. They are often called "smiling sammies" because they appear to be smiling. </p>

	<h2>Temperament</h2>

	<p>Samoyeds are generally friendly and gentle. They are known to keep a puppy disposition even after reaching adulthood. This can often mean they are harder to train. They are also very independent dogs. Samoyeds are usually very vocal although they are poor guard dogs because they are friendly to everyone. They are excellent companions for children and other dogs. </p>

	<h2>Health</h2>

	<p>Samoyeds are overall healthy but they can be affected by a disease known as Samoyed heredity glomerulopathy, a renal disease. Responsible breeders will watch out for hip, eye, and cardiac disorders. </p>

	<h2>Activity</h2>

	<p>As they were bred to be working dogs, Samoyeds need lots of activity to stay healthy and happy. They should be exercised daily. Because they were bred to herd and pull sleds, they have a strong tendency to run away so it is best to keep them in a fenced yard or on leash.</p>
